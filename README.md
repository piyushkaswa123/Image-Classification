# Image Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an image classification project using machine learning techniques. The project aims to classify images into predefined categories with high accuracy by leveraging advanced ML algorithms. It includes steps from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, with well-documented code and explanations.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles raw image data by resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
- **Model Implementation:** Utilizes popular ML models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance evaluation.
- **Visualization:** Includes confusion matrix and training history visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks & Libraries:**
  - TensorFlow/Keras
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above
- pip (Python package manager)
- A GPU setup (optional, but recommended for faster training)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/piyushkaswa123/Image-Classification.git
    cd Image-Classification
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset
Use any publicly available image dataset, such as CIFAR-10 or ImageNet. Ensure the dataset is organized into folders, with each folder representing a class.

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset by placing it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python src/train.py
    ```
3. Evaluate the model:
    ```bash
    python src/evaluate.py
    ```
4. Visualize results by running:
    ```bash
    python src/visualize_results.py
    ```
